        <Paragraph>OUR ethos at Gabbyâ€™s is a holistic one, and we believe that the health of the animals, the planet and our customers are. Intrinsically linked. We are passionate about helping our customers transition to a more plant-based diet because we believe that as well as being better for the planet, a reduction In animal products is better for human health. A diet that consists of too many additives , refined sugar and salt is most definitely not healthy ,but we also believe that animal fats are equally detrimental and that is it about finding balance.
